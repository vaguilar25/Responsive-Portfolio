                    I was born in Guatemala city, I have 39 years old, mother of two teens. Currently live in SF, I
                    really enjoy this beautiful city, it offers a lot of things to do, you just have to make time for
                    everything :).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to travel, visit new places and also meet new people, on my free time I like to do exercise,
                    go outdoors with my boys and I am passionate about photography. I am part of the clubs of
                    photographers of Guatemala, which is a group of very talented photographers that meet once a month
                    to show their work and participate in a contest to gain recognition in the club. I have gain a lot
                    of recognitions because of my work and have exposed my work also in galleries.
                </p>

                    I love dogs, I have two dogs, one is a pomeranian and the other one is a corgi, both are very funny
                    guys and we are happy to have them as a part of our family.
